# Which college majors will pay the bills?

Wondering if that Philosophy major will really help you pay the bills? Think you're set with an Engineering degree? Choosing a college major is a complex decision evaluating personal interest, difficulty, and career prospects. Your first paycheck right out of college might say a lot about your salary potential by mid-career. Whether you're in school or navigating the postgrad world, join me as we explore the short and long term financial implications of this major decision.

In this notebook, we'll be using data collected from a year-long survey of 1.2 million people with only a bachelor's degree by PayScale Inc., made available here by the Wall Street Journal for their article Ivy League's Big Edge: Starting Pay. After doing some data clean up, we'll compare the recommendations from three different methods for determining the optimal number of clusters, apply a k-means clustering analysis, and visualize the results.

To begin, let's prepare by loading the following packages: tidyverse, dplyr, readr, ggplot2, cluster, and factoextra. We'll then import the data from degrees-that-pay-back.csv (which is stored in a folder called datasets), and take a quick look at what we're working with.
